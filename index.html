            <h2>Sound of Snow Falling</h2>
            <p>White plummets from the heavens, feathers </br>
               Plucked from the wings of angels</br>By a frost-born giant</br>Grinning through his blood stained teeth.</br>The fallen angels are whisked away by the sin</br>
               Of humanity, their bodies bound to earthly trifles,</br>Bereft of redemption.</br></br>I sit divided,</br>Only an onlooker</br>To this violent storm.</br>
               The thin glass between cruelty and I trembles in</br>Its wake.</br></br>Cold kiss upon the window</br> Threaten to lay me to rest.</br>My icy bones thaw in security,</br>As newspaper kindling crackles,</br>The headline lost to flames</br>Dancing an unknown beat in this endless</br>Winter.</br></br>I pity any soul stuck out</br>
               On the frozen battlefield</br>Of beauty and death.</br>Both hauntingly mirror one another</br>As impossibilities to mankind</br>Never to be known in their</br>Purest form.</br></br>Outstretched like a loose invitation</br>Beneath a blanket of my own thoughts</br>My chest fills with a glow akin to that</br>Of a mother's embrace as</br>
               I succumb to the comfort of my sanctuary.</br></br>If only I had read that now purning paper</br>I would've realized its contents.</br>A naked body.</br>Covered in snow.</br>Pronounced Dead.</br>Only minutes from the small cabin</br>That I rest in.</br>A picture of my face</br>Strewn across the front page. </p>
